# CONTRIBUTING.md

Describe conventions to contribute to a project:

- git workflow (feature-branches, clean history, PR, develop and master branches)
- conventions on commit messages

Everything is written to a CONTRIBUTING.md file at root of the project.

Note: this is a playground for myself and projects I had.
