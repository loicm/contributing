# CONTRIBUTING.md

When working in a team (daily job, opensource project, whateverâ€¦) it may be a good practice to add a CONTRIBUTING.md file at the root of your project sources.

It can describe conventions to contribute to a project so that everyone knows how to do it:

- git workflow (feature-branches, clean history, PR, develop and master branches)
- conventions on commit messages

The CONTRIBUTING.md available here is not intented to be a standard nor the best solution.
It's a file I used on projects that you can take for ideas (or reuse as is).

Explicit (simple) rules are always better than implicit ones.
